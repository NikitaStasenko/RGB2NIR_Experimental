# RGB2NIR_Experimental
This repository contains several image-to-image translation models, whcih were tested for RGB to NIR image generation.  The models are Pix2Pix, Pix2PixHD, CycleGAN and PointWise.
The dataset including RGB and NIR images is located here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uJx_SLi0ePYqhn-lJ8p5whAy5spUsect?usp=sharing, where "RGB_Images" and "MSI_images containg RGB and mltispectral images acquired with digtial and multispectral 9 band camera at the same time periods, respectively.
